This chapter the programs are pretty simple and work pretty well.  The prompt 
for the intermediate Car Rental program has an errant "use and if statement" 
in it that doesn't make sense as there isn't any decision making in the program 
and adding features that would use the if statement would make it far more 
complicated than the challenging program.  The chief challenge I faced on the 
Personal Photo program was getting my images small enough in size to not crash 
out the program by using too much memory.  Not sure if that limitation is due 
to my phone or to the way Android Studio is running the debug process.
